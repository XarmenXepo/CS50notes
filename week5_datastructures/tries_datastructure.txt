Tries is short for 'retrieval'.
It is a tree of arrays.
Searching/addition/deletion in Tries use the Big O(1) notation, which is constant time.
The con of using Tries is needing alot of memory.

When written in code, as an exmale of a phonebook:

typedef struct node
{
    struct node *children[26] \\26 characters of the alphabet
    char *number \\when it is NULL instead of number, the program knows to continue following the * pointer until a (phone) number is found
}node;
