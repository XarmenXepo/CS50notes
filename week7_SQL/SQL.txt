:::::::::Using sqlite3 to read .csv type files:::::::::

Start sqlite: sqllite3

Set the mode to read a csv file: .mode csv

Import a .csv file for sqlite3 to read: .import myfile.csv myfile
This creates a .db type file, from the original .csv file, which is optimized for sqlite to read.

Run some sql commands ie. SELECT * FROM myfile

To avoid race conditions in SQL queries, we can create atomic transactions to wrap relevant code together
Instead of executing line by line, it will execute as a package
db.execute("BEGIN TRANSACTION")
db.execute("COMMIT")
