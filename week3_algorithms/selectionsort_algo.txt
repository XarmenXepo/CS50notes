Selection Sort algorithm

What is:
goes through a list
searches for the smallest (or largest) element
placing the smallest (or largest) element at the front (or back)
keeping track to search for only ONE element at a time
Formula for total number of steps required is on the order of N squared: O(nÂ²)
Con:
it involves alot of comparing this one element with the search again and again and slow
it runs through entire list and does not take in to account that list may already be sorted, for advantge of exiting early if so



Pseudo code for Selection Sort algorithm:

for i from 0 to n-1
    find smallest number between numbers[i] and numbers[n-1]
    swap smallest number with numbers[i]
