Pseudocode for Bubble Sort algorithm

repeat n-1 times
    for i from 0 to n-2
        if numbers[i] and numbers[i +1] out of order
            swap them

    if no swaps
        quit

do not use n+1 in this for loop as we are looking within a range of items, not trying to add to a range of items
using n+1 would result in the iteration looking beyond the last item
using n-2 ensures the iteration stays within the boundaries of the array while sorting from position o through n

using n-1 ensures the iteration does not waste compute checking on the last item in the range
as in Bubble Sort algorithm, the item in the last position already is in the correct place

the asymtoctic complexity of Bubble Sort algorithm is of Î©(n)
